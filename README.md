- 👋 Hi, I’m Adam Seeley
- 👀 Its great to meet everyone, I'm super excited to be part of the team.  I joined on January 4th as Head of Sales reporting in to Alex Finneore.  This is a new role for the organization, to free up Alex for addition revenue gererating initatives.  I join the team with over 15 years in sales, across SaaP, PaaS, and my last 8 years working in a similar digital consultancy leading a team of Business Develoment Managers across the globe.  My main focus will be driving new business, and landing stategic partnerships that align to our full stack engineering.  I find it fasicating to work with bright minds and learning the complex business problems our clients will look to Theorem to solve!
- 🌱 Fun Facts:
My favorite band is Tool, and went on a 9 concert tour with them back in 2019, and have a 6 concert tour for their 2022 tour (fingers crossed covid doesn't cancel it again :).  I have a 1 yr old Bernese Mountain dog puppy named Bronson. I once rescued a gentleman who had a heart attack and drove his car into the intracoastal water way in Florida, and broke his window under water and pulled him to saftely. Happy to say the gentlman lived, and I was awarded a key to the city.
